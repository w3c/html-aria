<!-- Important:
  for PRs that introduce normative changes the 'needs implementation commitment' 
  and the 'needs changelog entry' labels are needed.  If this is not a PR that
  introduces normative changes, then these labels can be removed.

  For normative changes, log the necessary bugs/rule change requests to the 
  following checkers. If a checker has already implemented the rule, then
  mark it as complete and remove the todo/link.
